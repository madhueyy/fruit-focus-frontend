                    Satoru Gojo (Japanese: 五条 悟, Hepburn: Gojō Satoru) is a
                    fictional character from Gege Akutami's manga Jujutsu
                    Kaisen. He was first introduced in Akutami's short series
                    Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School as the mentor of
                    the cursed teenager Yuta Okkotsu at Tokyo Prefectural
                    Jujutsu High School. This miniseries became the prequel
                    Jujutsu Kaisen 0 of Jujutsu Kaisen. In Jujutsu Kaisen, Gojo
                    takes the same role but mentors the student Yuji Itadori who
                    suffers a similar Curse, helping him become stronger while
                    protecting other characters in the series. Gojo was designed
                    by Gege Akutami to be a formidable yet endearing figure who
                    is passionate about his students. He is voiced by Yūichi
                    Nakamura in Japanese and Kaiji Tang in English in the
                    animated adaptations by MAPPA. The character was well
                    received by the media for his carefree nature and power
                    shown when protecting his students, becoming the series's
                    breakout character. Furthermore, his role in the prequel
                    Jujutsu Kaisen 0 was appreciated by the media due to his
                    hidden depths such as his relationship with the antagonist
                    Suguru Geto. The twist of the manga chapter involving Gojo's
                    death led to manga artist Kenjiro Hata go on a hiatus from
                    writing the manga Fly Me to the Moon due to the need of
                    recovering from the "shocking" event. According to IGN,
                    Akutami received death threats over the death of Gojo which
                    came across as a shocking event to several manga readers. In
                    September 2023, leaks of the manga's 236th chapter cause a
                    major controversy online within fans of the series. The
                    contents of the chapter surprised fans so much that they
                    took to social media to react to the new development. At
                    time of publication, the "#GojoSatoru" hashtag was trending
                    on X with more than 11,400 posts. Comic Book Resources had
                    mixed opinions about Gojo's death, praising the event for
                    the major impact it resulted in the entire narrative since
                    nearly most of the surviving characters watching his death
                    were his students but still felt like Akutami was trying too
                    hard to make Jujutsu Kaisen a dark series by killing several
                    characters in the Shinjuku arc.{" "}

                    Gojo's death despite his confidence when confronting Sukuna
                    and Kenjaku became famous in social media due to the ironic
                    result.

                    The character has often been compared with Killua Zoldyck
                    from Hunter × Hunter due to physical and personality
                    similarities. When Mariya Ise was cast to portray the
                    younger Gojo in a flashback from the anime's second season,
                    Hindustan Times said the "meme came to life" as Ise was also
                    popular for voicing Killua and fans were happy with such
                    casting.
